# Credit Card Fraud Detection (Data Cleaning & Analysis)

This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a credit card fraud dataset.  
It highlights the severe imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

## 🔹 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab
- Dataset stored on Google Drive

## 🔹 Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset into Google Colab
2. Removed duplicates and checked for missing values
3. Summarized fraud vs. non-fraud counts
4. Visualized fraud distribution (bar chart + pie chart)
5. Saved cleaned dataset for future machine learning use

## 🔹 Results
- Fraudulent transactions are less than 1% of the dataset
- Clean dataset saved as `Clean_creditcard.csv` for modeling

---

📌 Next Steps: Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) on this cleaned dataset.
